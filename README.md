# [Project 2: Analysis on used cars sales data: Project overview](https://github.com/JJuvakka/Data_science_excel_projects)
* Dowloaded the data from Kaggle to find out the most common used car brand and fuel type in Germany
* Cleaned and filtered data
* Made pivot tables and figures to illustrate the findings
* Run a linear regression to find out the depreciation of used Volkswagen Golf cars
* Critique: Price data is asking prices which probably makes the regression to overestimate the values
